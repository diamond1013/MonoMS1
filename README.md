DeepMS1

In this work, we propose DeepMS1, which utilizes the four dimensions of information provided by MS1 features, including accurate molecular weight, retention time, ion mobility, and peptide detectability, to facilitate peptide identification without MS/MS information. We employed the MS1 features with corresponding MS2 as the training set to construct a linear regression model, which assigned optimized weights to the four-dimensional MS1 information, generating an integrated peptide scoring function encompassing all the four dimensions of the MS1 features. Furthermore, by applying the target-decoy approach to assess the accuracy of the DeepMS1 outcomes, we demonstrated that enhanced MS1 feature detection substantially increased peptide and protein group identification under stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control. The developed method was applied to the analysis of serum proteome and single cell proteome, which can serve as a complementary to the current MS/MS-based proteomics analysis.
